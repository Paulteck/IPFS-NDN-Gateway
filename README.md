# IPFS-NDN-Gateway

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for the Gateway node that bridges **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)** and **Named Data Networking (NDN)**. The Gateway receives IPFS requests and translates them into NDN requests, enabling interoperability between the two decentralized networking architectures.

## Features
- Translates IPFS requests into NDN requests
- Enables communication between IPFS and NDN networks

## Prerequisites
Before running the Gateway, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Go** (for IPFS-related components)
- **NDN Packet Library** (NDN framework)
